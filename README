Hello world!

This is just a little repo to figure out how GitHub works.
There's an actual hello world program and makefile in src/

Todo:
-Learn how to use .gitignore so I can use "git add ." again without pushing up an executable. (I'll bet it's as simple as it sounds)

Pushing up changes:
git add . && git commit -m 'what you changed' && git push

Oh, I'm also checking whether commits show up if they were committed one day and pushed another (in Github's user profile).
